# Quantile Estimation Module Documentation Template

This template provides a step-by-step guide and example prompt for documenting any Python module (e.g., `quantile_estimation.py`) in a style consistent with best practices for technical and developer documentation.

---

## 1. Docstring Requirements

Add or update detailed and informative Google-style docstrings following these guidelines:

### Module-level docstring:
- Brief description of the module's purpose and core functionality
- Key methodological approaches or architectural patterns used
- Integration context within the broader framework
- Focus on salient aspects, avoid trivial descriptions
- Do not add any type hints in the doc strings.

---

## 2. Documentation File Requirements

Create a comprehensive `.rst` documentation file in `docs/developer/components/[module_name].rst` with:

### Structure Example:

```
[Module Name] Module
===================

Overview
--------
[Brief description and key features]

Key Features
------------
[Bullet points of main capabilities]

Architecture
------------
[Class hierarchy, design patterns, architectural decisions]

[Methodology/Algorithm Sections]
-------------------------------
[Detailed explanations of key approaches, mathematical foundations where relevant]

Usage Examples
--------------
[Practical code examples showing common usage patterns]

Performance Considerations
-------------------------
[Computational complexity, scaling considerations, best practices]

Integration Points
-----------------
[How this module connects with other framework components]

Common Pitfalls
---------------
[Common mistakes and how to avoid them]

See Also
--------
[Cross-references to related modules]
```

### Content requirements:
- Technical depth appropriate for developers
- Mathematical foundations with LaTeX equations where relevant (cite relevant papers if mainstream, do not hallucinate, if unsure do not cite any)
- Practical usage examples with actual code
- Performance and scalability guidance
- Integration context within the framework
- Best practices and common pitfalls
- Cross-references to related components

---

## 3. Index Update

Update `docs/developer/components/index.rst` to include the new module documentation in the appropriate section.

---

## 5. Best Practices
- Documentation should be contextually relevant and technically accurate
- Focus on methodology and implementation details that matter to developers
- Provide both theoretical understanding and practical guidance
- Ensure consistency with existing documentation style and organization
- Make it easy for both newcomers and experienced developers to understand and use the module

---

## 6. Example Output (for quantile_estimation.py)

See the current `quantile_estimation.py` for a fully documented example, and `docs/developer/components/quantile_estimation.rst` for a comprehensive documentation file.
