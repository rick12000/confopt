# Coding Style Guidelines

- Adopt the DRY principle. If code is repeated in multiple places, it should be functionalized and called in those places.
- Make all inputs explicit. Avoid relying on state or shared context unless encapsulated.
- Avoid implicit behavior (e.g., mutation of input lists, in place dataframe modification).
- Variable names should be descriptive and reduced to the shortest possible length.
- If a function returns multiple types, refactor. Don't return Union[str, dict, None].
- Use pytest.mark.parametrize for testing functions with categorical input values.
- If mocking in unit testing is required, mock external APIs and I/O only.
- No print() statements anywhere in the code. Use logging instead.
- No single-letter variable names unless in mathematical contexts or loops.
- No hard coded values. Use constants or configuration files.
- Don't use early returns in if else statements.
- Don't create classes if functions are sufficient.
- Keep modules small and focused (under 500 lines).
- Comments should explain why, not what. Keep comments under 10% of code.
- Don't write docstrings.
- Don't rely on default values for function arguments.
- Avoid *args or **kwargs unless absolutely necessary.
- Use pydantic models for configuration values.
- Always comply with DRY and SOLID principles.
- Use as little code as is necessary to carry out the desired functionality, do not over-engineer or over-validate your code.
- Write easily testable and maintainable code.
- Maximize separation of concerns.
- Consider how your changes will affect the wider codebase, think several dependancies ahead.
