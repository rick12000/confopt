# Quantile Estimation Module Documentation Template

This template provides a step-by-step guide and example prompt for documenting any Python module (e.g., `quantile_estimation.py`) in a style consistent with best practices for technical and developer documentation.

---

## 1. Docstring Requirements

Add detailed and informative Google-style docstrings following these guidelines:

### Module-level docstring:
- Brief description of the module's purpose and core functionality
- Key methodological approaches or architectural patterns used
- Integration context within the broader framework
- Focus on salient aspects, avoid trivial descriptions

### Class docstrings:
- Clear purpose statement and intended use cases
- Key algorithmic or methodological details
- Parameter descriptions that focus on methodology rather than obvious descriptions
- Computational trade-offs and performance characteristics where relevant

### Method docstrings:
- Purpose and methodology explanation
- Args section with parameter shapes where applicable
- Returns section with output shapes and descriptions
- Raises section for error conditions
- Implementation details for complex algorithms

### Coding style compliance:
- Follow the user's coding guidelines (DRY, explicit inputs, descriptive variables, etc.)
- Be informative but brief and to the point
- Only keep the most salient aspects of methodology or approach
- Base understanding on contextual analysis of the module and its usage in the codebase

---

## 2. Documentation File Requirements

Create a comprehensive `.rst` documentation file in `docs/developer/components/[module_name].rst` with:

### Structure Example:

```
[Module Name] Module
===================

Overview
--------
[Brief description and key features]

Key Features
------------
[Bullet points of main capabilities]

Architecture
------------
[Class hierarchy, design patterns, architectural decisions]

[Methodology/Algorithm Sections]
-------------------------------
[Detailed explanations of key approaches, mathematical foundations where relevant]

Usage Examples
--------------
[Practical code examples showing common usage patterns]

Performance Considerations
-------------------------
[Computational complexity, scaling considerations, best practices]

Integration Points
-----------------
[How this module connects with other framework components]

Common Pitfalls
---------------
[Common mistakes and how to avoid them]

See Also
--------
[Cross-references to related modules]
```

### Content requirements:
- Technical depth appropriate for developers
- Mathematical foundations with LaTeX equations where relevant
- Practical usage examples with actual code
- Performance and scalability guidance
- Integration context within the framework
- Best practices and common pitfalls
- Cross-references to related components

---

## 3. Index Update

Update `docs/developer/components/index.rst` to include the new module documentation in the appropriate section.

---

## 4. Example Prompt

```
I need comprehensive documentation for the [MODULE_NAME].py module. Please follow these specific requirements:

1. Add detailed and informative Google-style docstrings at the module, class, and method level, focusing on methodology, purpose, and integration context. Avoid trivial descriptions.
2. Create a detailed `.rst` documentation file in `docs/developer/components/[module_name].rst` with:
   - Overview, key features, architecture, methodology, usage examples, performance considerations, integration points, common pitfalls, and see also sections.
   - Technical depth, mathematical foundations, and practical code examples.
3. Update `docs/developer/components/index.rst` to reference the new documentation file.
4. Ensure all documentation is contextually relevant, technically accurate, and consistent with the style and structure of the rest of the project.

Start by analyzing the module structure and usage patterns, then proceed with the documentation following this template.
```

---

## 5. Best Practices
- Documentation should be contextually relevant and technically accurate
- Focus on methodology and implementation details that matter to developers
- Provide both theoretical understanding and practical guidance
- Ensure consistency with existing documentation style and organization
- Make it easy for both newcomers and experienced developers to understand and use the module

## 6. Example Output (for quantile_estimation.py)

See the current `quantile_estimation.py` for a fully documented example, and `docs/developer/components/quantile_estimation.rst` for a comprehensive documentation file.
