Ensemble Estimators
===================

The ensembling module (``confopt.selection.estimators.ensembling``) provides ensemble methods that combine predictions from multiple base estimators to improve predictive performance and robustness. The ensembles use cross-validation based stacking with constrained linear regression meta-learners to optimally weight individual estimator contributions.

Overview
--------

Ensemble methods leverage the principle that combining diverse models often yields better performance than any individual model. The module implements two specialized ensemble approaches:

- **PointEnsembleEstimator**: Combines regression estimators for point predictions
- **QuantileEnsembleEstimator**: Combines quantile regression estimators for distributional predictions

Both ensembles support two combination strategies:

- **Uniform Weighting**: Equal weights for all base estimators (simple averaging)
- **Linear Stacking**: Learned weights through cross-validation and constrained regression

The stacking approach provides automatic model selection capabilities, allowing poor-performing estimators to be effectively turned off through sparse regularization.

Mathematical Foundation
-----------------------

**Ensemble Prediction:**

The general ensemble prediction combines base estimator outputs:

.. math::

   \hat{y}_{\text{ensemble}}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^M w_i \hat{y}_i(x)

Where:
- :math:`w_i`: Weight for estimator i
- :math:`\hat{y}_i(x)`: Prediction from estimator i
- :math:`M`: Number of base estimators

**Uniform Weighting:**

.. math::

   w_i = \frac{1}{M} \quad \forall i

**Linear Stacking:**

Weights are learned by solving a constrained optimization problem:

.. math::

   \min_w \frac{1}{2} \|Pw - y\|_2^2 + \alpha \|w\|_1

Subject to:
- :math:`w_i \geq 0` (non-negativity)
- :math:`\sum_{i=1}^M w_i = 1` (weights sum to 1)

Where :math:`P` is the matrix of out-of-fold predictions and :math:`\alpha` controls sparsity.

BaseEnsembleEstimator
---------------------

The abstract base class provides common functionality for ensemble implementations, including weight computation strategies and validation logic.

**Key Features:**

- **Strategy Pattern**: Supports multiple weighting strategies through unified interface
- **Cross-Validation Framework**: Implements k-fold CV for unbiased weight learning
- **Regularization Control**: Configurable Lasso regularization for sparse solutions
- **Validation Logic**: Ensures minimum estimator count and parameter validity

**Core Parameters:**

``estimators`` (List[BaseEstimator])
   Base estimators to combine. Must be scikit-learn compatible with fit/predict methods.

``cv`` (int, default=5)
   Number of cross-validation folds for stacking. Higher values provide more robust weight estimates but increase computational cost.

``weighting_strategy`` (Literal["uniform", "linear_stack"], default="linear_stack")
   Weight computation method:

   - **"uniform"**: Equal weights (1/M for M estimators)
   - **"linear_stack"**: Learned weights via constrained Lasso regression

``random_state`` (int, optional)
   Random seed for reproducible cross-validation splits and weight learning.

``alpha`` (float, default=0.01)
   Regularization strength for Lasso regression. Higher values produce sparser solutions, effectively turning off poor estimators.

**Abstract Methods:**

``predict(X)``
   Must be implemented by subclasses to provide ensemble predictions.

PointEnsembleEstimator
----------------------

Combines multiple regression estimators for point (single-value) predictions using either uniform averaging or learned stacking weights.

**Mathematical Framework:**

For point predictions, the ensemble combines scalar outputs:

.. math::

   \hat{y}_{\text{ensemble}}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^M w_i \hat{y}_i(x)

**Cross-Validation Stacking Process:**

1. **Data Splitting**: Divide training data into k folds
2. **Model Training**: For each fold, train all base estimators on k-1 folds
3. **Out-of-Fold Prediction**: Generate predictions on held-out fold
4. **Stack Assembly**: Combine OOF predictions into meta-learning matrix
5. **Weight Optimization**: Solve constrained Lasso problem for optimal weights

**Implementation Details:**

``_get_stacking_training_data(X, y)``
   Generates out-of-fold predictions for meta-learner training using k-fold cross-validation.

   **Algorithm Steps:**

   1. **K-Fold Setup**: Create k cross-validation splits with shuffling
   2. **Fold Processing**: For each fold (train_idx, val_idx):
      - Train all base estimators on X[train_idx], y[train_idx]
      - Generate predictions on X[val_idx]
      - Store predictions and validation indices
   3. **Data Assembly**: Combine all out-of-fold predictions and targets
   4. **Return**: Validation indices, targets, and prediction matrix

``_compute_weights(X, y)``
   Computes ensemble weights based on the selected weighting strategy.

   **Uniform Strategy:**

   .. code-block:: python

      weights = np.ones(len(estimators)) / len(estimators)

   **Linear Stacking Strategy:**

   1. **OOF Generation**: Get out-of-fold predictions via cross-validation
   2. **Data Preparation**: Sort predictions by validation indices
   3. **Constraint Setup**: Configure non-negativity and sum-to-one constraints
   4. **Lasso Fitting**: Solve constrained optimization problem
   5. **Weight Extraction**: Return learned weights from meta-model

``fit(X, y)``
   Trains all base estimators and computes ensemble weights.

``predict(X)``
   Generates ensemble predictions by combining base estimator outputs with learned weights.

**Performance Characteristics:**

- **Training Complexity**: O(k × M × C) where k=CV folds, M=estimators, C=base model cost
- **Prediction Complexity**: O(M × P) where P=base model prediction cost
- **Memory Usage**: O(n × M) for storing out-of-fold predictions
- **Robustness**: Higher than individual estimators through diversity

QuantileEnsembleEstimator
-------------------------

Combines multiple quantile regression estimators for distributional predictions, supporting separate weight learning for each quantile level.

**Mathematical Framework:**

For quantile predictions, the ensemble combines quantile-specific outputs:

.. math::

   \hat{q}_\tau^{\text{ensemble}}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^M w_{i,\tau} \hat{q}_{i,\tau}(x)

Where :math:`w_{i,\tau}` are quantile-specific weights, allowing different estimator importance across the prediction distribution.

**Multi-Quantile Stacking:**

The key innovation is learning separate weights for each quantile level:

1. **Quantile-Specific OOF**: Generate out-of-fold predictions for all quantiles
2. **Per-Quantile Optimization**: Solve separate Lasso problems for each quantile
3. **Quantile-Aware Combination**: Use quantile-specific weights during prediction

**Implementation Details:**

``_get_stacking_training_data(X, y, quantiles)``
   Generates quantile-specific out-of-fold predictions for meta-learner training.

   **Algorithm Steps:**

   1. **Cross-Validation Setup**: Create k-fold splits for robust estimation
   2. **Quantile Prediction**: For each fold and estimator:
      - Fit estimator on training fold
      - Predict all quantiles on validation fold
      - Store predictions organized by quantile level
   3. **Data Organization**: Return predictions grouped by quantile for weight learning

``_compute_quantile_weights(X, y, quantiles)``
   Computes ensemble weights separately for each quantile level.

   **Uniform Strategy:**

   .. code-block:: python

      weights_per_quantile = [
          np.ones(len(estimators)) / len(estimators)
          for _ in quantiles
      ]

   **Linear Stacking Strategy:**

   1. **OOF Generation**: Get quantile-specific out-of-fold predictions
   2. **Per-Quantile Optimization**: For each quantile τ:
      - Extract predictions for quantile τ
      - Solve constrained Lasso with pinball loss
      - Store quantile-specific weights
   3. **Weight Collection**: Return list of weight vectors, one per quantile

``fit(X, y, quantiles)``
   Trains all base quantile estimators and computes quantile-specific weights.

``predict(X)``
   Generates ensemble quantile predictions using quantile-specific weight combinations.

**Quantile-Specific Advantages:**

- **Adaptive Weighting**: Different estimators can dominate at different quantiles
- **Tail Specialization**: Some estimators may excel at extreme quantiles
- **Robustness**: Poor performance at one quantile doesn't affect others
- **Flexibility**: Accommodates heterogeneous base estimator architectures

Cross-Validation Stacking Details
----------------------------------

Both ensemble types use sophisticated cross-validation stacking to learn optimal weights:

**Unbiased Prediction Generation:**

The k-fold approach ensures unbiased meta-learning:

1. **No Data Leakage**: Each prediction is made on data not used for training
2. **Full Coverage**: Every sample appears in exactly one validation fold
3. **Robust Estimation**: Multiple folds provide stable weight estimates

**Constrained Optimization:**

The weight learning problem includes essential constraints:

**Non-negativity**: :math:`w_i \geq 0`
   - Prevents negative contributions that could destabilize predictions
   - Ensures interpretable combination of base estimators

**Sum Constraint**: :math:`\sum_{i=1}^M w_i = 1`
   - Maintains prediction scale consistency
   - Provides natural regularization against extreme weights

**Sparsity Regularization**: :math:`\alpha \|w\|_1`
   - Automatically identifies and removes poor estimators
   - Provides robustness against overfitting in weight learning

**Lasso Implementation:**

The constrained Lasso problem is solved using scikit-learn's Lasso with appropriate preprocessing:

.. code-block:: python

   # Normalize constraint: sum(w) = 1 becomes w @ ones = 1
   # Transform problem to unconstrained form
   lasso = Lasso(alpha=self.alpha, positive=True, fit_intercept=False)
   lasso.fit(predictions_normalized, targets_adjusted)
   weights = lasso.coef_ / np.sum(lasso.coef_)  # Renormalize

Integration with Conformal Prediction
--------------------------------------

Ensemble estimators integrate seamlessly with the conformal prediction framework:

**Point Ensemble Integration:**

- **LocallyWeightedConformalEstimator**: Can use PointEnsembleEstimator for both point and variance estimation
- **Improved Robustness**: Ensemble reduces sensitivity to individual model failures
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Better point predictions lead to more efficient intervals

**Quantile Ensemble Integration:**

- **QuantileConformalEstimator**: Can use QuantileEnsembleEstimator as base quantile predictor
- **Distribution Modeling**: Better quantile estimates improve interval quality
- **Asymmetric Handling**: Ensemble captures complex distributional patterns

**Usage Examples:**

.. code-block:: python

   # Point ensemble for locally weighted conformal prediction
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
   from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
   from lightgbm import LGBMRegressor

   point_estimators = [
       RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100),
       Ridge(alpha=1.0),
       LGBMRegressor(n_estimators=100)
   ]

   point_ensemble = PointEnsembleEstimator(
       estimators=point_estimators,
       weighting_strategy="linear_stack"
   )

   # Use in conformal estimator
   conformal_estimator = LocallyWeightedConformalEstimator(
       point_estimator_architecture="ensemble",  # Custom registration
       variance_estimator_architecture="lightgbm",
       alphas=[0.1, 0.05]
   )
