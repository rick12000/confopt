   :alt: Benchmark Results

**ConfOpt** is significantly better than plain old random search, but it also beats established tools like **Optuna** or traditional **Gaussian Processes**!

The above benchmark considers neural architecture search on complex image recognition datasets (JAHS-201) and neural network tuning on tabular classification datasets (LCBench-L).

For a fuller analysis of caveats and benchmarking results, refer to the latest methodological paper.

ðŸ”¬ Theory
==========

ConfOpt implements surrogate models and acquisition functions from the following papers:

- **Adaptive Conformal Hyperparameter Optimization**: `arXiv, 2022 <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2207.03017>`_

- **Optimizing Hyperparameters with Conformal Quantile Regression**: `PMLR, 2023 <https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/salinas23a/salinas23a.pdf>`_
